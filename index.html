        <p>As I predicted, I had lots of time to procrastinate, and I did. I did not implement any of the improvments I planned on, but the site still largely works as before:
            still using Reddit accounts, one big pool, and manual score updates. I was able to write some tests to make future changes less risky.
            In my defense, I was unexpectedly busier over the summer than I thought I would be. ðŸ’œ
